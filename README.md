# Load Balancing Web App

## What is this?

I implemented a ToDo list web application that load balances 3 Tomcat servers. This is deployed using various AWS services: EC2 instances for each Tomcat server,  RDS for the MySQL database, and Elastic Load Balancer to support the load balancing.

## Where can I see it?
I deleted my instances a long time ago since AWS charges build up very quickly. I was charged about $40 after a few days. 

However, for those still interested, I have images of my deployment details below:
